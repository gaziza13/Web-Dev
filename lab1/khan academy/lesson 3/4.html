        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Slice the camembert in half through the equator and put one half, cut-side up, in a large round baking dish
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Poke half the garlic slices and half the rosemary leaves into the cheese and drizzle over 1 tbsp olive oil. Bake for 15 mins until oozing and golden at the edges. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain, reserving a mugful of the cooking water.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Tip the pasta, cream, spinach and 2 tbsp of the parmesan into the baking dish with the camembert, season and toss with a splash of the reserved cooking water, breaking up the camembert until everything is coated in the sauce.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Put the other half of the camembert on top of the pasta, cut-side down. Pierce a few holes in the rind and poke in the remaining garlic and rosemary. Lay the prosciutto over the pasta, scatter over the remaining parmesan, drizzle the remaining oil over and bake for 10 mins until the cheese has melted. Serve straight from the baking dish.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Heat the oil in a wide non-stick pan with a tight-fitting lid. Fry the onions and potatoes for about 5 mins, or until starting to soften. Add the peppers, courgettes, tomatoes and garlic, then stir in the vinegar, if using, the bouillon and 200ml water. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 25 mins, or until the peppers and courgettes are very tender (if your pan doesn’t have a tight-fitting lid, wet a sheet of baking parchment and place over the stew before covering – this helps keep in the juices).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Add the hake fillets, mussels and prawns, then cover and cook for 5 mins more, or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Scatter over the parsley and serve.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Sieve the flour, baking powder and a generous pinch of salt into a large bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, mash the very ripe bananas with a fork until smooth, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla extract and milk. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, tip in the wet ingredients and swiftly whisk together to create a smooth, silky batter.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Heat a little knob of butter in a large non-stick pan over a medium heat. Add 2-3 tbsp of the batter to the pan and cook for several minutes, or until small bubbles start appearing on the surface. Flip the pancake over and cook for 1-2 mins on the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter, keeping the pancakes warm in a low oven.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Stack the pancakes on plates and top with the banana slices, a glug of sticky maple syrup and a handful of pecan nuts, if you like.</p>
